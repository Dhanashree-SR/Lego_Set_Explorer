## Welcome to the LEGO Finder Dashboard project! ðŸš€

This interactive Power BI dashboard was built to help LEGO enthusiasts explore over 4,000 LEGO sets. It allows users to easily filter and discover the perfect LEGO set based on age group, theme, and more.

## Project Overview

The LEGO Finder Dashboard is a custom Power BI tool designed for discovering LEGO sets that suit your preferences. With this dashboard, you can:

* **Filter LEGO sets by age group** (5-9, 10-17, 18+)
* **Explore by themes** (Star Wars, Marvel, Icons, and more)
* **Hover to preview LEGO set images**, theme groups, and related themes
* **Use slicers, bookmarks, and numerical range parameters** to simulate an app-like experience

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Age Group Filters**: Easily filter LEGO sets based on age groups to find age-appropriate options.
* **Theme Exploration**: Browse LEGO sets by popular themes like Star Wars, Marvel, Icons, and more.
* **Interactive Experience**: Use slicers and bookmarks to create an engaging, interactive experience.
* **Real-time Image Previews**: Hover over sets to instantly view LEGO set images, themes, and more.
* **DAX Measures**: Utilized DAX to calculate metrics like average price, total number of sets, and pieces.

## Skills & Tools Used

* **Power BI**: The dashboard was built using Power BI, incorporating DAX, slicers, bookmarks, and other advanced features.
* **DAX**: Applied DAX to calculate key metrics such as average price, total sets, and total pieces.
* **Power BI Features**: Used slicers, numerical range parameters, bookmarks, and report page tooltips for dynamic interaction.
* **Maven Analytics**: This project was part of the LEGO Set Explorer challenge in Maven Analytics.

## How to Use
